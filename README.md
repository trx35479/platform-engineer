# platform-engineer
Coding challenge for Platform Engineers

# Description
- This repo contains a simple http server written in Golang that returns a data.

# Instruction
1. Create a `private` repo in your own github account and invite us as collaborator.
2. Build the code, preferably using ci/cd pipeline. 
3. Instantiate an infrastructure, it could be a GKE, EKS or a VM. You can use Terraform, Ansible, chef, puppet or any automation that you are comfortable with.
4. Load the app to the cluster and expose a load balancer or public IP that we can access the app.

# Expectation
1. Github repo with a documentation
2. Properly structure code

Note: We understand that this may incure cost so once the public endpoint is available, hit us an email so we can verify. Once verified you can take down the infrastructure.
