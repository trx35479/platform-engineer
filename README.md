# Platform Engineer
Coding challenge for Platform Engineers

# Description
- This repo contains a simple api written in Golang that returns a set of data

# Instruction
1. Create a `private` repo in your own github account and invite us as collaborator.
2. Build the code using ci/cd pipeline, use any tools that you are comfortable with.
3. Instantiate an infrastructure, it could be a kubernetes cluster (GKE, EKS or AKS) or a VM in any public cloud. Use Terraform, Ansible, chef, puppet or any automation that you are comfortable with.
4. Deploy the app in to the cluster, secure it and expose the api server endpoint publicly.

# Expectation
1. Github repo with a documentation
2. Properly structured code
3. We can access the api server publicly

Note: We understand that this may incur cost so once the public endpoint is available, hit us an email so we can verify. Once verified you can take down the infrastructure.
