Coding challenge for Platform Engineers

# Description
- This repo contains a simple api written in Golang that returns a set of data.
- 

# Instruction
1. Create a `private` repo in your own github account and invite us as collaborator.
2. Build the code, preferably using ci/cd pipeline. 
3. Instantiate an infrastructure, it could be a kubernetes cluster (GKE, EKS or AKS) or a VM in any public cloud. Use Terraform, Ansible, chef, puppet or any automation that you are comfortable with.
4. Deploy and secure the app in to the cluster and expose the webserver to the outside.

# Expectation
1. Github repo with a documentation
2. Properly structure code
3. We can access the web server publicly

Note: We understand that this may incure cost so once the public endpoint is available, hit us an email so we can verify. Once verified you can take down the infrastructure.
